# hd2-mod-authoring — an OpenClaw AgentSkill

An [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) **skill** that teaches an AI
assistant how to author, install, and debug **Helldivers 2** mods on Linux.

It encodes the hard-won, field-verified lessons from shipping several real HD2
mods: the exact patch-container format, the memory layouts of the game's
settings tables, and the failure modes that each cost a game test.

## What it covers

- **Install classification** — Lua patch vs Wwise bank vs translation-only addon.
- **Writer-conflict detection** — catch two mods double-applying the same value.
- **Memory-patch discipline** — one scan, cached reads, field-selective maintain.
- **Value-scan safety** — full-signature guards for health/armor patching.
- **Programmable-ammo wheel** — the safe way to add a second selectable round.
- **Packing + deploy** — patch header format, Arsenal folder quirks, Nexus unlink.
- **Field-verified offsets** — ProjectileSettings, DamageSettings, WeaponData,
  WeaponMagazine, ProjectileWeapon, HealthComponentData.

## Layout

- `SKILL.md` — the skill body.
- `references/` — offsets and formats, HUD overlay recipes, and a scanned mod
  catalog.

## Install

Copy the `hd2-mod-authoring/` directory into your OpenClaw skills directory:

```bash
cp -r hd2-mod-authoring ~/.openclaw/agents/main/agent/workshop-skills/
```

(or install it through ClawHub once it is published there).

## Caveats

Offsets, type hashes, and enum ids drift between game builds. The skill treats
them as verifiable hints, not constants — re-check any layout a game update
could move before trusting it.

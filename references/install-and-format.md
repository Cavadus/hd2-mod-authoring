# Install audit and patch format

Snapshot of `~/.config/hd2arsenal/mods` on 2026-10-01, then the retire the same day. The first count was 57 folders and 509 `.patch_0` files (47 Lua-like, 462 binary). After moving eight folders to `_retired` and adding `m1000_combined`, re-count before quoting it. Every container starts with magic `0xF0000011`. Bingus Shared Loader v18 is installed.

## Patch container (measured)

Dominator `Addon/9ba626afa44a3aa3.patch_0`:

- Byte 0: u32 magic `0xF0000011`.
- Byte `0x20`: u64 total file size.
- Byte `0x50`: u64 type `0xA14E8DFA2CD117E2` (Lua).
- Byte `0x68`: u64 MurmurHash64A of the addon-id string, seed 0.
- Byte `0xA0`: u32 Lua size plus 8.
- Byte `0xC0`: u32 Lua size.
- Byte 200: Lua source, nothing after it. `len(patch) == 200 + len(lua)`.

The header rebuilds as three little-endian structs, then payload (verified
byte-identical against the v2.7 patch on 2026-10-03):

```python
header   = struct.pack('<III20sQQ24s', 0xf0000011, 1, 1, b'', length, 0, b'')  # 72 B
type_ent = struct.pack('<IIQIIII', 0, 0, LUA_TYPE, 1, 0, 16, 16)                # 32 B
res_ent  = struct.pack('<7Q6I', murmur64(addon_id), LUA_TYPE, 192, 0,0,0,0,
                       len(payload), 0, 0, 16, 16, 0)                           # 80 B
```

72+32+80 = 184, pad to 192, then `payload = struct.pack('<II', len(source), 2) + source`.
`length = 192 + len(payload)` — it is NOT rounded to 16. `tools/archive_writer.py`'s
`(offset+len(payload)+15)//16*16` is for the arena mod and gives a wrong size field here.
`murmur64` is MurmurHash64A, seed 0, `m=0xc6a4a7935bd1e995`.

The filename `9ba626afa44a3aa3.patch_0` is a shared slot name, not a type. Lua uses type `0xA14E8DFA2CD117E2`. The Dominator Space Marine II firing sound is that same filename, 2454160 bytes, type `0x535a7bd3e650d799`, and byte 200 is not Lua. It was copied verbatim from the WWSC archive entry `Jar-5 Dominator - Bolter/Space Marine II/9ba626afa44a3aa3.patch_0` into Include folder `Space Marine II/`. Some resource patches do use other names (`0a4bd8a1833f11b2`, `1577e917ad1f287d`). Do not rename those, and do not run either kind through the Lua packer.

## Our mods

- JAR-5 Dominator - Rechambered, addon `mods/dsh/dominator_bolt_pistol`, source `hd2-mods/dominator-rechambered/jar5_dominator_rechambered.lua`. Current release `v3.1` (safe source-round wheel, see SKILL section 11). Manifest `Name` is `JAR-5 Dominator - Rechambered` (hyphen). The colon form is not a Windows folder; HD2 Mod Manager uses `Name` as the storage directory. The zip stays flat. Its thumbnail is that release's 2048 png with a third line, `SPACE MARINE II BOLTER`, under `RECHAMBERED`. Do not copy into a suffix remembered from this file: `hd2a_data.json` `path` is the live folder. The suffix was `_AR246946` in the morning snapshot, `_AR519378` later that day, and `_AR513425` on 2026-10-02. The second top-level option, "Space Marine II firing sound", Include `Space Marine II`, is on by default and independent of `Addon`. `MEMORY.md` still says dbp-1.1.
- Exosuit Rebalance, addon `mods/recon/exosuit_ammo`, source `hd2-mods/exosuit-ammo/exosuit_ammo.lua`, Arsenal folder suffix `_AR269359`. Not for public upload.
- M-1000, addon `mods/recon/m1000`, source `hd2-mods/m1000/m1000.lua`, Arsenal folder `m1000_combined`. Not a Nexus upload.
- Realistic Weapons v1.1, addon `mods/recon/realistic_weapons`, uuid `7c1e5a42-6b08-4d3f-9e77-1a4b8c2d6f50`, source `hd2-mods/realistic-weapons/`. One scanner. The checkboxes are `mods/recon/realistic_weapons_{onetwo,arbitrator,adjudicator,evictor,mg206}` and do not scan. Read the live folder from `hd2a_data.json`. The suffix was `_AR737561` later the same day.
- Dixie Horn, uuid `29c07aae-f32a-41db-a921-cf7f61c86fe1`, source `hd2-mods/dixie-horn/`. Wwise bank, not Lua. The folder name still contains Nexus mod id 15084. `nexusData` was set to `null` on both records on 2026-10-01.
- Mech Part HUD v1.13.0, addon `mods/recon/mech_part_hud`, uuid `1fb3e783-e499-4d32-85d4-48251e1576e9`, source `hd2-mods/mech-part-hud/`. Read-only. It does not write health or ammo, so it is not a second writer next to Exosuit Rebalance or DRIVER HUD. `nexusData` is null. Zip `hd2-mods/mech_part_hud_v1.13.0.zip`. Do not import that zip over the installed uuid. The folder name may still contain Nexus id 16514; that is not the link.

## Glyph-atlas labels (Mech Part HUD, 2026-10-01)

Drawn strings were `title.cn` and the destroyed literal. `zones.lua` `zh=` was never read. `render_mech.lua` `D.ZH` was unused. `arm_labels` was passed into `draw` and never read there.

Big charset before the English rebuild: `0123456789%-/EXO5` plus the CJK set. Small charset: `0123456789%-/损毁`.

Panel width 170. At 13px, room beside `EXO-49` and `100%` was 87.1px with Noto Sans Regular. `EMANCIPATOR` was 89.7 and did not fit. IBM Plex Sans Condensed Regular left 91.1px of room and the name was 79.5. Paths: `/usr/share/fonts/truetype/ibm-plex/IBMPlexSansCondensed-Regular.ttf` and `IBMPlexSansCondensed-Bold.ttf`. Small `DEAD` at 9px bold was 21.8px.

`gen_art.py` regenerates `src/art.lua`. The geometry before `["fonts"]`, starting at `return `, was 8192 bytes and matched the previous art. Shipped nicknames: PATRIOT, EMANCIPATOR, LUMBERER, BREACHER. Destroyed reads DEAD.

After the patch copy, the live folder still had the Chinese README (5148 bytes) and `Source/src/art.lua` (189987 bytes). Unzipping the new package over that folder replaced them. v1.13.0 deleted `LICENSE-NOTO-CJK.txt`. A UTF-8 scan of the v1.13 zip found no CJK.

A spatial arm link is kept. `if AR.spatial then AR.list=nil` rediscovered every poll (default 0.25s) and walked the Health-owner table. `spatial_validate` only re-samples positions of the suits already in the snapshot. `Arms.verify` bulk-reads the entries blob and the descriptor pointers. v1.13.0 rechecks positions every poll, calls `Arms.verify` every 5 seconds, and drops the list immediately when the error contains `SPATIAL_` or the seated suit changes. A new suit is not in the old snapshot, so the 5-second walk stays. Do not put the every-poll wipe back.

`python tools/build.py` imports `lupa.luajit21` and fails with `ModuleNotFoundError`. `tools/archive_writer.py` `archive()` does not. Lua type is still `0xA14E8DFA2CD117E2`. The assembled source starts at byte 200. The literal `HD2-Addon` is at 203 because the line begins `-- `.

## Overlaps

Removed 2026-10-01. The folders are in `~/clawd/hd2-mods/_retired/`. They were in `modsLibrary` and not in the active profile:

- `mods/recon/exo45_ammo` — Patriot Ammo v1 and v1.1, same addon id, two folders
- `mods/recon/lumberer_ammo` — Lumberer Ammo v1 and v1.1, same addon id, two folders

`mods/recon/exosuit_ammo` still writes those magazine capacities. Do not put the ammo mods back.

`mods/recon/exo45_armor` (the standalone Exosuit Armor +1 fork) writes the same armor fields that are now folded into `exosuit_ammo`. Do not install the standalone `exosuit_armor_v*.zip` alongside the merged Exosuit Rebalance — it double-applies (+2 armor instead of +1). The merged mod is the single correct writer.

M-1000 is one mod, `m1000_combined`, addon `mods/recon/m1000`. The old AP4 and free-movement Lua were one scanner with opposite `*_done` flags. SUPER-GUN and AA sights stay binary options. The enabled suboptions at the merge were Crysis Hurricane Minigun and vanilla muzzle flash.

The separate SHODAN tuners (`mods/shodan/arbitrator_tuning`, `adjudicator_tuning`, `evictor_tuning`, `mg206_tuning`) are not the writers. Realistic Weapons v1.1 replaced them with `mods/recon/realistic_weapons`.

## Tables verified against game data

To find a component type you have not patched before, do not grep the on-disk `data/game/dl_library.dl_typelib` — it is encrypted (readable strings are garbage). The type names are compiled into the filediver binary: `strings /tmp/filediver/filediver-cli/filediver | grep -oE '[A-Za-z]+ComponentData'`. The LDLD type hash in memory is `dlsum(type_name)` (e.g. `dlsum("WeaponMagazineComponentData")` is `0xFB8D88A3`); the dlsum algorithm itself is not written down here yet. (2026-10-02, unresolved: a mech armor-rating request named HealthComponentData / DestructibleComponentData / DamagePropagatorComponentData / OverlapDamageComponentData / DamageZoneShieldComponentData as candidates but did not pin which holds armor or its offset.)

The same binary also embeds the datalib Go **struct field names** as json tags, so
an unknown field is discovered the same way — this is how impact sound was traced:
`strings filediver | grep -oE 'json:"[a-z_0-9]+'` lists field names, and
`strings filediver | grep -iE 'ProjectileSettings|PhysicsImpact|SurfaceImpact|Explosion'`
lists struct/enum names (`PhysicsImpactEffectComponentData`, `PhysicsImpactEffectInfo`,
`SurfaceImpactSetting`, `ExplosionSettings`, `SurfaceImpactType_*`). Use the field
names to name an offset you are reverse-engineering before trusting it. Impact
effects are a SEPARATE lookup, not a projectile-record field: the projectile only
stores `surface_impact_type` / `ricochet_impact_type` enum indices; the sound,
camera shake, and decal live on `PhysicsImpactEffectInfo` (`audio_effect_id`,
`camera_effect_id`, `shake_effect_id`, `decal_sheet`, `quake_effect`, `effect_type`).

WeaponMagazineComponentData, type size 52000. Hashmap 8640 bytes, then 271 records times 160. Capacity is +136. Also +140 magazines, +144 refill, +148 max, +152 threshold. Exosuit anchors on vanilla capacity plus magazines 0, refill 6, max 0, threshold 0, except the autocannon branch skips the max check.

ProjectileWeaponComponentData type `0x45171B68`, stride 616, projtype at +0, weapon function projectile at +576 (`weapon_function_projectile_type` — the programmable-ammo alternate round). Patriot entity hash `0x08F6089289C83D22`. Used for the MG-206 round swap (148 to 275), not for magazine size.

WeaponDataComponentData type `0x88E4DBB1`, stride 1232, keyed by weapon entity. The Dominator's entity hash is `0x80F1A156D9FA1E36` (lo `0xD9FA1E36`, hi `0x80F1A156`) — the SAME value as its network-descriptor resource, verified against SHODAN's WEAPONS catalog. `0xB6AFF2195568767F` is the R-36 Eruptor, not the Dominator. Holds recoil (drift +0/+4, climb +28/+32) and the weapon-function selector `function_info` at +184 (left) / +188 (right), u32 enum: none=0, zeroing=1, rate_of_fire=2, magazine=4, fire_mode=5, muzzle_velocity=7, programmable_ammo=8.

ProjectileSettings type `0xBD4042C2`, record stride derived at runtime (hint 272). Dominator ProjectileType 177. This is the warhead and ballistics table. Projectile field offsets (Dominator `OFF_*`): mode label +12 (u32 localisation id), mode icon +16 (u64 resource, little-endian), speed +32, mass +36, drag +40, gravity +44, simulation steps +48 (u32), lifetime +52, lifetime randomness +56, damage type +60, explosion on impact +144, explosion on expire +156, arming distance +160. Impact-visual offsets (the Dominator `VISUAL_FIELDS`, present on every projectile and identical across the 15x100mm family): disintegration effect +112/+116 (u64 lo/hi, zero on the 15x100mm rounds), decal size +164, surface impact type +168 (u32 enum, =4 on the Dominator and P/40-K), ricochet impact type +172 (u32, =3), effect damage type +220.

DamageSettings type `0xE0A72CF0`, stride 76 — the damage/durable/AP/force records. A distinct **settings-array** shape, not the hashmap (WeaponMagazine) or bucket-array (ProjectileWeapon) shapes: LDLD header (24 bytes), then a `{u64 ptr, u64 count}` pair at header+24. The record array is at `ptr` when `ptr > 0x10000`, else at `header+24+ptr` (relative). Record: id +0, damage +4, durable +8, ap_direct +12, ap_slight +16, ap_large +20, ap_extreme +24, demolition +28, stagger +32, push +36 — all u32. Identify a record by the full 9-field vanilla signature, never by id (values recur and the id is not stable). Detect "already patched" by counting records that already match the target signature against a known baseline (the EAT-17 profile already exists exactly once in a vanilla game). The exosuit EAT-17 rocket buff (1250/1250 AP 6/6/5/0 -> 2000/2000 AP 6/6/6/3) uses this.

HealthComponentData, type hash `0xB3915DE3` (dlsum("HealthComponentData")), record stride 22096 (0x5650), 502 records, hashmap 1002 slots, data at +16032. The exosuit armor + health table. Record layout:
  +0    main health (hull 1800)
  +64   default zone (a zone header: armor +216, max-armor +224, health +232)
  +520  zone array, 38 zones of 552 bytes (zone armor +216, health +232)
Real mech body zone health values: 400 (cockpit/hips), 550 (legs), 10 (lights). Body default-zone armor is 4. Arm components (main health 800, one zone of health 800) have default-zone armor 3. The record array address cannot be derived from the LDLD header; find it by scanning memory for the health values 1800/550/800.

Value-scan pitfall (this caused a game crash): matching only "main health 1800" (or "+280 == 4") writes armor into unrelated data. A value-scan MUST require the full signature before writing — main health 1800 AND default armor 4 AND at least one zone with a known health (400/550/10) — then write only the confirmed zones. "+1 to all armor" needs this; a plain "raise AV3->AV4" was safe because it only wrote exact value 3 with exact health 550/800.

Close-range bounce, tested 2026-10-01 and reverted. None of these writes are in the shipped Lua. `v2.6` only changed the `REVISION` string for the sound release:

- Offset 176 `max_ricochets`, stock 1. Writing 0 makes an unarmed hit detonate. The arming toggle still logged (`12.0 m, ricochets 0` vs `0.1 m, ricochets 1`).
- Offset 180 `ricochet_threshold_angle`, stock 83 (`0x42A60000`). Writing 180 and writing 0 did not stop tree or rock deflections. The log showed the new angle.
- Offset 136 is `explosion_threshold_angle`, stock 80 (`0x42A00000`), not the 83° field. Writing 180 changed nothing. Both 136 and 180 are `layout_ok` anchors. A write the checker does not allow fails `maintain` and reverts.
- Square ground hits were already eaten. Trees and rocks still deflect. Those two angles do not control that split. Do not retry these three writes.

Cremator flame binary patches: type hash `0xa8193123526fad64`, baked addon hash `0xe3d15622a42863c4`. Two identical files cover the Lumberer flame and the FLAM-40 sentry flame.

## Wwise bank swap

Re-list banks after a game update. If `filediver` is not on PATH, the xypwn/filediver v0.7.57 CLI is a static binary. Do not scan `Helldivers 2/data/bundles.*` (about 25 GB) until that list is empty:

```bash
filediver --gamedir "$STEAM/steamapps/common/Helldivers 2" \
  --list-format '%N %T' --include '*frv*' --types wwise_bank
```

On 2026-10-01 that list was `content/audio/vehicle_frv`, `content/audio/wep_frv_heavy_flamer`, and `content/audio/wep_frv_supply_autoturret`. The M-102, M-103 Supply, and M-104 Incinerator share `vehicle_frv`, and that bank holds the horn. The other two are the weapon banks. Do not ship a second copy of the horn bank per vehicle while this is still true.

The 2026-08 Dixie patch was a full-bank replace. Against that day's vanilla `vehicle_frv.bnk` it was missing event id 3058490728 and 32 WEM ids. Horn WEM 761194215 was 29636 bytes vanilla and 407654 bytes in the Dixie RIFF. The rebuild keeps vanilla BKHD and HIRC, replaces that WEM, and pads each WEM to a 16-byte boundary.

Dixie container, measured on the pre-rebuild patch: magic `0xF0000011`. The u32 at offset 308 is the bank length. `BKHD` starts at 320. After HIRC the tail is `content/audio/vehicle_frv` plus padding. When the bank changes length, write the new length at 308. Do not use the Lua size fields at `0xA0` and `0xC0`. The zip root is `manifest.json`, `thumbnail.png`, and `9ba626afa44a3aa3.patch_0`, with no Options key and no `Addon/` folder. `Guid` is the installed uuid.


## Reusable constants (cross-confirmed 2026-10-02)

- `0xFB8D88A3` dlsum("WeaponMagazineComponentData") — magazines/ammo.
- `0x45171B68` dlsum("ProjectileWeaponComponentData") — projtype at +0, programmable-ammo function projectile at +576.
- `0x88E4DBB1` dlsum("WeaponDataComponentData") — recoil and `function_info` selector at +184/+188.
- `0xE0A72CF0` dlsum("DamageSettings") — the damage-type table (Dominator reads damage/durable/AP from it; LAS-98 and MS-11 patch it).
- `0xB3915DE3` dlsum("HealthComponentData") — exosuit health + armor.
- `0xC6A4A7935BD1E995` MurmurHash64A multiplier; the low 32 bits `0x5BD1E995`. The packer (murmur64a addon-id hash) and the EXO Stratagem Launcher both use it.
- `0x6AB3B43F` a game.dll layout anchor seen in Armored Overhaul, Field Repair, and the Mech Part HUD's game.dll identity pair (6AA96B14/6AB3B43F). Not a table type; a build/layout check.
- Config-file pattern: read `%LOCALAPPDATA%` key=value overrides at load so tunables change without repacking. Dominator `read_overrides` is the example. A value that can be a string sentinel (`speed=off`) must be matched against the literal BEFORE `tonumber` — `tonumber('off')` is nil, so a numeric branch checked first silently drops the sentinel and leaves the field on its default.
